# This is a comment.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @cubxxw and @kubbot will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.
*       @cubxxw  @kubbot

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies JS files, only @js-owner and not the global
# owner(s) will be requested for a review.

# Teams can be specified as code owners as well. Teams should
# be identified in the format @org/team-name. Teams must have
# explicit write access to the repository. In this example,
# the kubecub team in the github organization owns all .txt files.

# `docs/build-app/troubleshooting.md`.
